## Comparison

| Kinematic                                              | PID                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| More traditional + fully featured character controller | Seems to interact with other rigid bodies better + with less lag for continuous collisions (pushing objects around) |
|                                                        | Is more likely to tunnel (fall/phase through objects)                                                               |

## Conclusion

Use PID if your character will be doing a lof of pushing objects around, otherwise stick to kinematic
