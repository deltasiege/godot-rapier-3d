# Godot Rapier 3D ü§∫

## What is this?

A [GDExtension][gdext-link] that enables the [Rapier physics engine][rapier-link] within [Godot][godot-link].

It is _not_ a drop-in replacement for the Godot physics engine. Rapier nodes operate separately from Godot physics.

### Features

- Cross platform determinism ‚úîÔ∏è (confirmed via [actions](https://github.com/deltasiege/godot-rapier-3d/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)!)
- Physics manual stepping ‚úîÔ∏è
- Physics saving & loading ‚úîÔ∏è

### Requirements

- Godot 4.4 or later

## Quickstart

1. Download the [latest --all release](https://github.com/deltasiege/godot-rapier-3d/releases/latest)
1. Extract the release archive into your godot project's root directory
1. Add a RapierRigidBody3D node to your scene and RapierCollisionShape3D + MeshInstance3D nodes as children of the rigid body
1. Run your game

Your physics objects should simulate! üéâ

## Roadmap

This extension is currently under heavy development, compatibility when upgrading versions is not assured until 1.0.0

- [x] Visualize colliders
- [x] Snapshots & stepping
- [x] Determinism automated testing
- [x] Collider shapes
- [ ] Forces and manipulating rigidbodies
- [ ] Visualize active vs inactive bodies
- [ ] Collision layers
- [ ] Save/load snapshots to/from resource files
- [ ] Editor UI to facilitate simulating in editor
- [ ] Gizmo handles for collider shapes
- [ ] Add to Godot asset library
- [ ] [Property comments](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext/issues/178)

## Limitations

- No mobile support ([godot-rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext/issues/24))
- `rv64`, `ppc64` and `ppc32` architecture automated testing for determinism [not yet officially supported](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3374#issuecomment-2142165372)
